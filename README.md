Only Icons: Bookmark Shortcuts
==============================

This is an Add-on for Firefox.

By deleting the label of bookmarks which were added to the bookmarks toolbar,
these can be used as icon shortcuts. Since this approach constitutes in a loss
of information, a context menu entry for handling this task transparently is
provided by Only Icons. Just hide the bookmark label with only one click.
